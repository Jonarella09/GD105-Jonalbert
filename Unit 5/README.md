# Unit 5 Directory

This directory contains files related to Unit 5.

GitHub repositories typically display the contents of directories that contain files or other directories directly within their root. 

This placeholder file, named README.md, is here to ensure that the "Unit 5" directory is visible on the main page of the repository. GitHub displays the contents of directories that contain only one subdirectory without showing the parent directory on the main page.

Feel free to navigate into specific subdirectories for more content.
